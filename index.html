                    <p>I am a software developer currently residing in Philadelphia, PA.</p>
                    <p>I used to be a chef. Because of that in my coding, I like:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Adding twists to classic's</li>
                        <li>Writing code that is efficient yet readable</li>
                        <li>Working with my team to produce quality products in a timely fashion</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>After working in kitchens for a long time, I felt like I was destined for more. So, I decided to
                        return to college for a 2nd degree. This time in my other passion, IT. Before finishing I took a
                        few web design and programming classes and fell in love. But it was too late to switch majors.
                    </p>
                    <p>While working in IT for the past 5 yrs, I continued to pursue coding in my free time. But once I
                        moved to Philly, I decided it was time to make a move, and I enrolled as a full-time student at
                        Thinkful. I couldn't be happier!</p>
                    <p>I'm excited to learn and grow as a professional developer and work with others who share my
                        passion. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team or you just want to build together, please
                        reach out!</p>
